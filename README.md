# Web BDD Test Automation Framework

## Overview
This framework is designed for automating web application testing using a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. It provides a structured way to write, execute, and report automated tests, with built-in support for configuration management and detailed test reporting.

## Key Features
*   **BDD Ready**: Structured to support BDD methodologies (e.g., using Cucumber or a similar tool).
*   **Configuration Management**: Utilizes an external `config.properties` file for easy management of test parameters and framework settings.
*   **Extent Reporting**: Integrates with ExtentReports for generating comprehensive HTML test execution reports.
    *   Supports report overriding: choose to overwrite the previous report or create a new timestamped report for each test run.
*   **Centralized Path Management**: Uses `FrameworkConstants` to manage crucial file and directory paths, ensuring consistency.

## Project Structure (Key Directories)
*   `src/test/resources/`: Contains test-related resources.
    *   `config.properties`: The primary configuration file for the framework.
*   `reports/extent-test-output/`: The default directory where Extent HTML reports are generated.

## Configuration
Framework behavior and test environment details are configured via the `src/test/resources/config.properties` file.

One key property managed by `FrameworkConstants.java` is:
*   `OVER_RIDE_REPORTS`:
    *   Set to `yes`: The `index.html` report in the `reports/extent-test-output/` directory will be overwritten with the latest results upon each execution.
    *   Set to `no` (or any other value): A new report file, prefixed with a timestamp (e.g., `1625070000000index.html`), will be created in the `reports/extent-test-output/` directory for each execution, preserving previous reports.

## Getting Started
*(This section would typically include:
*   Prerequisites (Java version, Maven/Gradle, browser drivers, etc.)
*   Setup instructions (cloning the repository, installing dependencies)
*   How to write tests (feature file examples, step definition guidance)
)*

## Running Tests
*(This section would detail how to execute the automated tests, for example:
*   Using a build tool: `mvn clean test` or `gradle test`
*   Running specific features or scenarios
*   IDE-specific run configurations
)*

## Viewing Reports
After test execution, detailed HTML reports generated by ExtentReports can be found in the `reports/extent-test-output/` directory.
*   If the `OVER_RIDE_REPORTS` property in `config.properties` is set to `yes`, the report will be named `index.html`.
*   Otherwise, the report will have a unique name incorporating a timestamp, such as `<timestamp>index.html`.
